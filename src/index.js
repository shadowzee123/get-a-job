import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
// This is the entry point of the React application.
// It imports the necessary modules, styles, and the main App component, then renders the App component into the root element of the HTML document.
// The index.css file contains global styles for the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components.
// ReactDOM.createRoot is used to create a root for the React application, which is then rendered with the App component.
// This setup allows for a modular and maintainable structure, where the App component serves as the main container for all other components in the application.
// The use of React.StrictMode is not included here, but it can be added for development to help identify potential problems in the application. 
// This code is essential for bootstrapping the React application and rendering it to the DOM, making it the starting point for the entire user interface of the GetAJob application.
